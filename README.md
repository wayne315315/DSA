# Basic operation on a dynamic set S 
Each element x in S has a key k and associated satelite data
- Insert(S, x) : Insert the element into S whose pointer is x
- Delete(S, x) : Remove the element from S whose pointer is x
- Search(S, k) : Return a pointer y in S such that y.key = k. Otherwise, return None
- Minimum(S) : Return a pointer y which y.key is the smallest key among S
- Maximum(S) : Return a pointer y which y.key is the largest key among S
- Successor(S, x) : Return a pointer y in S whose key is next larger than x's. If x is maximum, return None
- Predecessor(S, x) : Return a pointer y in S whose key is next smaller than x's. If x is minimum, return None
